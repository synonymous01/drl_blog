                <h2>Theater and the Art of Resistance</h2>
                <img src="reference_files/A_COVID-less_Fall_Semester.png" class="img-rounded" alt="bruh">
                                <p>Theatre is a rather arduous form of performative art, for it does not enjoy the luxury of
                curating a fictional reality through extensive audio and visual effects rather it relies heavily
                upon an orchestrated, cohesive alliance between the performers on stage and the crew
                off-stage. The actors surreptitiously slip cues to those behind the curtains and without an air
                of rehearsal, both aural and visual unite to induce a stupor upon an unsuspecting audience
                and even that reaction in itself is premeditated. The contorting faces of the performers are
                only successful in persuading those seated near the stage for the contortion becomes
                distorted for those further away yet the illusion does not escape even the farthest one for it is
                the variation in voice that truly drives the created reality. The dynamic octaves of an actor’s
                voice do not merely reverberate amongst the audience with dramatic intention rather they
                also possess the ability to shake the pillars of bigotry and complicity, for art can compel man
                to confront internalised ideologies. No wonder regimes of terror and intolerance attempted to
                reconstruct the institution of art in the lands they occupied, for they recognised the potential
                of influence it possessed. But as time has witnessed, wherever the right of expression was
                usurped, art emerged in the form of resistance, and Pakistan is no stranger to this tale.

                General Zia-ul-Haq was the sixth president of Pakistan and the third to impose martial law,
                entrenching the society in a decade-long era of intolerant darkness. His regime of terror is
                synonymous with the decline of the film industry. Heavy censorship and taxes, such as the
                legislation that demanded filmmakers to seek approval for projects from the Ministry of
                Culture and present a Rs. 200,000 bank guarantee, greatly compromised the quality of the
                content and production. The state, under the guise of ‘Islam’, propagated regressive,
                patriarchial agendas that infiltrated every level of citizen existence in the region. The
                ‘islamization’ marked a sharp decline for the Pakistani film industry and this decline outlived
                the tyrant himself. But not all abandoned hope and thus some brave artists, with heroic
                dispositions, rose against the oppressive regime and nurtured the genre of resistance, thus
                re-emerged the once lost art of protest theatre.

                In 1983, a group of spirited artists, led by Madeeha Guahar, pioneered a resistive theatre
                movement through a theatre group called “Ajoka”. The name in itself insinuated an
                exploration of the contemporary ills that had befallen the world of the commons and the
                creatives. The organized group became a symbol of resistance against systematic
                oppression of voices. A year after their formation, the group performed for the first time in the
                May of 1984, in a private gathering. The humbleness of their first stage had no ill bearing
                upon their zeal. With determination and passion the group performed the play “Jaloos” which
                was written by Badal Sarkar, an Indian dramatist, and directed by Madeeha Gauhar herself.
                The play sensitively criticised the dilemma of the crushed commons by the state machinery
                and the complicit role of the islamic clergy. The initiative was reflective of the groups daring
                ambition to re-introduce the ideas of peaceful co-existence and tolerance which had long
                been purged from the society by Zia-ul-Haq. In the successive year, the group became overt
                in its rebellion and through an adaptation of Bertolt Brecht’s chalk circle the symbolism
                became transparent, for the themes of corruption and its demise through humanity were
                greatly explored. Though their ventures had attracted great censure by those who supported
                and feared the regime yet the world’s derision also served as an encouragement for them to
                pursue their goals, serving as a reaffirmation of their need in the intolerant society. In 1987,
                two performances were staged, “Barri” and “Marya Hoya Kutta” respectively, written by
                Shahid Nadeem who drew inspiration from the personal struggles of Madeeha Guahar and
                various other women who were involved in a struggle to regain the liberty to live. “Marya
                Hoya Kutta” was a satirical commentary upon the complicit role of the islamic clergy along
                with the masses who were concerned with only their individual welfare, perhaps Nadeem
                held the common man’s silence in contempt for the longevity of the regime. The group
                served as a voice of resistance for those who failed to possess the courage to confront a
                tyrant. But the group was not an idiosyncratic venture rather a complementary force to its
                contemporary partner.
                </p>
                <p>
                A lesser known contemporary of this organisation was a group called “Lok Rehas”, founded
                by a group of artists and performers who were greatly troubled by the military oppression
                plaguing the realms of expression. Their vision complemented its contemporaries, for they
                too envisioned a society that inherently practised gender equity and democratic values. The
                group was known to stage classical performances, folk tales, adaptations of foreign plays
                and quick street skits often raising awareness under the guise of comedy and entertainment.
                Owing to the rebellious nature of the group their performances were limited to the streets
                and private gatherings, yet their message infiltrated the public psyche. They are known to
                have staged and performed more than 80 plays and organized over a 1000 performances.
                Every fortnight, the silent streets of the country were reimagined through their performative
                lens, instilling hope and the courage for resistance amongst the audience. Though time has
                rendered them nearly obscure in conversation, yet the fact that we enjoy a certain liberated
                degree of art today is a testament to their timeless efforts.
                </p>

                The regime of terror had unknowingly aided the revival of the punjabi theatre, which had
                traditionally featured “Bhands” and “Nautankis” engaged in folk and comical retellings and
                thus grown irrelevant with the passage of time. The oppressive decade allowed a
                contemporary lens to drive an art form that had inspired the locals for decades and thus
                marking the failure of those who wished to suppress art. Theatre became a voice for the
                voiceless and a beacon of hope in a time when all was lost.
