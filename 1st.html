                    LUMS Dramaline can easily be summed up as a non-profit, entertainment-based society committed to bringing out the immense creative talent among our student body, be it acting, directing, or scriptwriting. However, when you get to see the society function - it is more than that.
                    Many have this perception that Dramaline is only for actors, yet the history of this society shows differently. We have a multitude of departments that develop their own ideas and innovations and bring those forth into the world of drama, music and art. Wondering where you would fit into Dramaline? Here are all our current departments curated with information written by the department heads themselves.

                    Read on to see our plans for the online semester, the foundation of each department and what exactly we are looking for in aspiring applicants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>DISCLAIMER: </b>All sentences claiming that a specific department is the best are purely opinions. Do not let it fool you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Productions: </b>This is one of the most celebrated department of Dramaline. We are mainly part of the creative process that is accompanied by script writing, finding proficient actors and creating content for upcoming projects. Moreover, our work also involves finding and harnessing talent and displaying jaw-dropping performances thus representing the artistic side of the society!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Operations: The Operations department (read: backbone of the society) </b>is responsible for the logistics, finance, and administrative dealings. (We're the people bringing tables and chairs into the venue before an event and dragging them out after everyone leaves.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Registrations:</b> As the name suggests, the Registration Department at LUMS Dramaline is mainly responsible for registering delegates (both internal and external) for the society's annual events. They communicate with schools, cater to any queries regarding the event and guide participants through the registration process. This department's work starts before the event and continues until after the event has officially ended.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Marketing:</b> The LUMS Dramaline Marketing department deals with all the finances of the society and promotes its mission to the larger community. They reach out to prospective partners enabling them to play their part in the conservation and betterment of theatre.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>HR:</b> HR at Dramaline makes sure the cogs are running smoothly. We take attendance, help people lodge complaints, and make sure the society is motivated, comfortable, and a family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b> Affiliations and Outreach:</b> Affiliations and Outreach is a new department which previously came under and was managed by the Public Relations department. It is mainly created to increase the specialization of the department. The core purpose of this department is to help the society build and maintain industry relations, to gather partnerships and collaborations with media partners, theatre groups and universities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>  Public Relations:</b> As you can probably tell from the name, we innovate opportunities to make celebrities and renowned individuals a part of Dramaline. Our work focuses on extending Dramalines reach and make esteemed names a part of what we are all about here at Dramaline.
                    This year, our willingness to adapt to change has allowed us to revamp our vision into an online platform. Through specially designed projects, we hope to break the barriers of physical boundaries while creating an all encapsulating and holistic experience, providing a platform for budding artists to showcase their talents, hone their art, and, most importantly, provide quality entertainment. This is exactly why we have introduced some new, and some iterated departments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Design and Creativity:</b> The Design and Creativity department is where we (in collaboration with the rest of the society) conceive, design and produce the most attention-grabbing designs that not only showcase our events to our audiences but also who we are as a society.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>  IT and Tech:</b> We are focusing on converging all our social platforms into our official Dramaline website. On this website you will find regular updates on what Dramaline is up to and have access to our blog. Additionally, they are working on making a collective archive for previous Dramaline plays so that the consequent batches have access to valuable reference material.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b> Digital Media and Content Creation:</b> This department primarily revolves around cinematography and videography, as the name goes to show, and with all the societal work being online, it is proving to be one of the tougher departments to handle. Hence, we are involved in the creative and the executive processes involving all the projects that are to go down in the upcoming semesters, and are directly involved in working with majority of the other departments to help pump the content that they need out there!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Publications:</b> The publications department is a relatively newer department in Dramaline, and our job is to keep you all updated on the upcoming projects in Dramaline as well as the Paki and international arts and theater industry. We celebrate all forms of art, not just drama, so if you have something you'd like to showcase, we would be happy to provide that platform for you!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our vision is to revitalize the concept of Drama. We aim to encourage theatricality within the confines of our institution and across the entire country. As ambassadors of this art, our goal is to revive and protect it but we need your help? This Dramaline family needs you - will you join us?
                </p>
