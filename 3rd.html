                <p>
                    Welcome back to the blog! You didn't think we were done yet, right?
                </p>
                <p>
                    If hearing about our fall semester event lineup didn't intrigue you enough, here's some more excitement coming your way! Spring semester brings about an all new round of events.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alfaaz Humaray: This event features poetry, stand-up comedy, singing, and a whole lot of chill vibes. Walk up and perform whatever your heart desires. No better way to spend your Thursday night!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bridging Barriers: Ask any Dramaliner about this event and they'll say it was possibly the cutest event ever. Spending your weekends volunteering at schools, teaching children about drama, rounding them and taking their auditions as they adorably try to break out of their shell. Splitting  up in teams, we make short plays and teach each young one confidence and characterization for their final breakthrough performance in Lums. Probably the most rewarding and humbling experience throughout the year!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Annual Play: The event of the year! The most highly anticipated act of the year as people line up for the highly competitive auditions. Hosted at Al-Hambra Arts Council, our legacy includes "The Producers", "Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street", "Tom, Dick and Harry", "Haasil-e-Kun" and most recently, the hit musical "Mamma Mia"!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, we ensure numerous opportunities for students with an extremely packed year. In the midst of this, we also take out our External Play teams to universities around Pakistan (and come back donning shields!).
                </p>
                <p>
                    With such a diverse plethora of events, we make sure there's something for everybody and trust us, we'll find something perfect for you!
                </p>
