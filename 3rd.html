                <p>
                Welcome back to the blog! You didn’t think we were done yet, right?
                </p>
                <p>
                While the fall semester event line-up was totally intriguing, there’s a fair of spring semester excitement coming your way as well!
                </p>
                <p>
                Covid has hit everyone, everywhere, and schedules have gone wonky trying to catch up. But virtual doesn’t mean terrible, and all our events are packed with excitement wither way.
                </p>
                <p>
                Still, let’s look at our original spring semester and have take a trip down memory lane:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Alfaaz Humaray</b>
                        <p>
                        This event features poetry, stand-up comedy, singing, and a whole lot of chill vibes. In an in-person semester, you could easily just walk up and perform anything your heart desired. No better way to spend the night! 
                        However, this was one event we shifted to our virtual fall semester this year, and it went off with a blast of fun, internet problems (just kidding), and a whole lotta talent! 
                        Did you think it was worth it?
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Bridging Barriers</b>
                        <p>
                            Ask any Dramaliner about this event and they’ll say it was possibly the cutest event ever. Spending your weekends volunteering at schools, teaching children about drama, rounding them and taking their auditions as they adorably try to break out of their shell. Splitting up in teams, we make short plays and teach each young one confidence and characterization for their final breakthrough performance in LUMS. You could say this is probably the most rewarding and humbling experience of the year!
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Annual Play</b>
                        <p>
                            And here we have it - the event of the year! The most highly anticipated act has people lining up for the increasingly competitive auditions. Hosted at Al-Hamra Arts Council, our legacy includes “The Producers”, “Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street”, “Tom, Dick and Harry”, “Haasil-e-Kun” and most recently, the hit musical “Mamma Mia”! 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>x
                <p>
                Usually, all these events – action packed and filled with countless opportunities for the participants – happen smack dab in the middle of the spring semester. Well, a Before-Covid spring semester, at least.
                </p>
                <p>
                But the best thing about Dramaline is that adaptation is our greatest quality! Virtual events won’t lose to in-person ones, and with the chance to go online, our options just expanded by a huge degree.
                </p>
                <p>
                With such a diverse plethora of events, we try to make sure there’s something for everybody and trust us, (if we haven’t yet), we'll find the perfect opportunity for you!
