                The Dramaline goal has always remained simple – our attempt is to promote a vision of art and theatre within the walls of LUMS and outside it too. As ambassadors of this art, our goal is to revive and protect it. We strongly believe that amidst our nation lies a tremendous potential for dramatic talent. With a host of events during the year, we have an action packed regardless of whether it is virtual or in person. But, for the sake of nostalgia, let’s take a look back at our BC (before Covid!) fall semester events.
                </p>
                <p>
                Orientation: This is where the magic begins! Weeks of planning intros to make sure the incoming freshmen know what we’re all about and get intrigued to join. Each year we dare ourselves to get bigger and better to earn the “best society orientation” label. Did we win the virtual title? You tell us!
                </p>
                <p>
                Dramafest: Our flagship event, and Pakistan’s biggest student-organized school and collegiate theatre competition with a turnout of 5000+ audience over the span of 3 days. Acting. Singing. Dancing. Drama. Comedy. Any and every form of art. Need we say more?
                </p>
                <p>
                Art of Drama: New to theatre? No worries! Bringing in experts from the field, this event allows you to enter a relaxed environment where you can learn, practice and grow together. Oh and if you need any more incentives, it’s free. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Skit Tamasha: An intra-LUMS theatre competition, with the purpose of encouraging students to showcase their talents on the small(er) stage within the university. Call up a few friends, make a funny skit and perform in front of your peers. What could be a better confidence booster?
                </p>
                <p>
                We try to keep the same spirit alive even through our tiny, Zoom screens. If you thought fall semester was the end, however – honey, you've got a big storm coming! As this semester ends, we're gearing up for our AC (after Covid not Aitchison) spring semester events. We hope you’re just as pumped as we are!
                </p>
